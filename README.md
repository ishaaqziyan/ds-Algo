## Golang <br>
* Stack (Arrays, LinkedLists)
* Queues (Arrays, LinkedLists)
* Linked List
* Binary Search Tree (BST)
* AVL Tree
* Graph (Undirected Unweighted Graph)
* Recursion
* BFS (Breadth First Search)
* DFS implemented in BST |Pre-order| In-order | Post-order
* Sorting (Bubble, Selection,Insertion,Merge and Quick)
